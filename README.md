This repository comprises projects that I completed as part of my internship with Afame Technologies. The projects are:

* HR Data Analysis
* Titanic Survival Prediction

### Tools Used : Excel, Power BI , Python , Jupyter notebook.

## HR Data Analysis:


Data Overview:

The HR Data Analysis project involved the exploration and analysis of Human Resources data using Power BI. The dataset encompassed various aspects of employee information, including demographics, education, performance metrics, and employee satisfaction scores.


Techniques Used:

In this project, I leveraged the powerful capabilities of Power BI to perform advanced data analytics and visualization. Techniques employed included data cleaning, data modeling, and developing interactive dashboards and reports.


Final Analysis:

Using Power BI, I delved deep into the HR dataset to uncover meaningful insights. This included:-
Employee Demographics: Analysing the distribution of employees based on age, gender, and department.
Performance Metrics: Investigating key performance indicators such as employee productivity, attrition rates, and performance ratings.
Employee Satisfaction Scores: Examining data to gauge employee satisfaction levels and identify potential areas for improvement.



## Titanic Survival Prediction: 


Introduction:

This project predicts whether passengers on the Titanic survived or not.


Dataset:

We used a dataset from Kaggle that includes information about Titanic passengers like age, gender, and ticket class.


Data Preprocessing:

We cleaned the data by removing missing values and converting categorical variables into numerical ones.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

We looked at graphs and charts to see if factors like age, gender, or ticket class influenced survival rates.


Modeling:

We tried different machine learning models(KNN & SVC) to predict survival, like guessing based on age and gender.
We used Accuracy Score and Confusion Matrix to see how well our models performed.


Results:

Our best model(SVC) correctly predicted survival for 70% of passengers.


Conclusion:

We learned that factors like age and gender played a crucial role in predicting survival on the Titanic.
In the future, we could improve our model by considering other variables or trying different algorithms.
