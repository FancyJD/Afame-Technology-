This repository comprises projects that I completed as part of my internship with Afame Technologies. The projects are:

* HR Data Analysis
* Titanic Survival Prediction

### Tools Used : Excel, Power BI , Python , Jupyter notebook.

## HR Data Analysis:
## Titanic Survival Prediction: 


# Introduction:

This project predicts whether passengers on the Titanic survived or not.

Dataset:

We used a dataset from Kaggle that includes information about Titanic passengers like age, gender, and ticket class.

Data Preprocessing:

We cleaned the data by removing missing values and converting categorical variables into numerical ones.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

We looked at graphs and charts to see if factors like age, gender, or ticket class influenced survival rates.


Modeling:

We tried different machine learning models(KNN & SVC) to predict survival, like guessing based on age and gender.
We used accuracy score and Confusion Matrix to see how well our models performed.

Results:

Our best model(SVC) correctly predicted survival for 70% of passengers.

Conclusion:

We learned that factors like age and gender played a role in survival on the Titanic.
In the future, we could improve our model by considering other variables or trying different algorithms.
